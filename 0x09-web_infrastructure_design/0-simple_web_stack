Here's the explanation on how it works:
1. A user accesses www.foobar.com.
2. The user's computer resolves the domain name to the server's IP address.
3. The user's browser sends a request to the server.
4. Nginx receives the request and serves static content or forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
5. The application server processes the request, interacting with the database as needed.
6. The application server generates a response.
7. Nginx sends the response back to the user's browser.
8. The user's browser displays the web page.

However, there are some issues:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server goes down, the website becomes inaccessible.
Downtime During Maintenance: The website may experience downtime during maintenance.
Scalability Challenges: The infrastructure is not easily scalable.

To improve, consider adding redundancy, load balancing, and automation.
