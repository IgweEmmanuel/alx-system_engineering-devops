Here is the explanation to the added components or devices: 


Specifics:

1. Additional Server: Adding another server improves fault tolerance and scalability by distributing the workload across multiple servers.

2. HAProxy Cluster: Configuring HAProxy as a cluster ensures redundancy and high availability, minimizing the risk of downtime and service disruption.

3. Split Components: Hosting each component on its dedicated server enhances performance, security, and manageability, allowing for better resource allocation and isolation of services.

By adding these components and configurations, we ensure a robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant web infrastructure that meets the requirements for performance, availability, and security.
